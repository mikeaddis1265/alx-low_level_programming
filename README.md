# C - argc, argv
In these simple projects, I have earned about command line arguments passed to C functions with `argv` and `argv` as well as
how to use `__attribute__((unused))` or `void` casting to compile function without the flag errors that
comes along with unused variables or parameters.

## Projects :page_with_curl:
* **0. It ain't what they call you, it's what you answer to**
  *  [0-whatsmyname.c](./0-whatsmyname.c): C program that prints its name,
  followed by a new line.
  *  If the program is renamed, the program will print the new name without having
    to be compiled again.
  *  he path should not be removed before the name of the program
    
* **1. Silence is an argument carried out by other means**
  * [1-args.c](./1-args.c): C program that prints the number of arguments passed to
  it, followed by a new line.
